    There are times when we get tossed about  by the whirlwinds of life or find ourselves in perplexing and challenging situations and our minds get entangled and engrossed in resolving issues , we find it very difficult to meditate . There are times of stress and trauma , there are times when for a few days we are unable to  practice due to illness or guests in the house or  excessive work ………then we  must definitely seek a preceptor with whom we can talk and schedule face to face sittings so that we may regain our  balance and steady state of mind.
